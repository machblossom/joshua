1.  5 Topics related to astronomy, physics, technology, etc. that we found
    interesting were Telescopes, planets, rockets, aerospace engineering, galaxies, nebulae, space debris

2.  space debris impact on airplane https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/panic-at-36000-feet-boeing-737s-windshield-cracks-mid-air-space-debris-to-blame/articleshow/124698979.cms
    - this explores the impact of space debris and how dangerous it can be 
    F-15 destroying satelite in space https://theaviationgeekclub.com/the-story-of-the-celestial-eagle-the-only-f-15-fighter-jet-to-destroy-a-satellite/
    - this explores the importance of accuracy in regard to launching projectiles, deals with trajectory physics
    mapping space debris trajectory https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576525000396
    - this explores the methods going about tracking and mapping the trajectories of space debris

3.  in regard to space debris, we could use loops to constantly measure and map out space debris
    or satelite trajectories to accurately launch an object to such debris. This would deal with trajectory physics.

4.  a possible ambitious project idea could involve shooting down space debris with the help of physics trajectory equations
    while also making sure other objects (like planes, or kites) aren't in the way.
    another project idea could essentially be the same without much real-world influences and factors.
